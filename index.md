I am a Research Associate and a PhD candidate in the [Database Systems (DIMA)](https://www.dima.tu-berlin.de) group at [TU Berlin](https://www.tu.berlin/) mentored by [Volker Markl](https://www.dima.tu-berlin.de/menue/team/volker_markl/) and [Jorge Quiané-Ruiz](https://www.user.tu-berlin.de/quiane/). 

My current research has been focusing on bringing confidential computing to large-scale data processing and building the foundations of privacy-preserving cloud systems.

Before joining TU Berlin as a researcher, I completed an [EIT](https://www.eitdigital.eu/) double M.Sc. at TU Berlin and [UPM Madrid](https://www.upm.es/). During my Master's thesis, I collaborated with [Logical Clocks](https://logicalclocks.com) in Stockholm and developed infrastructure to enable streaming IoT data pipelines in [Hopsworks](https://www.hopsworks.ai/).
