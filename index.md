I am a Research Associate and a PhD candidate in the Database Systems (DIMA) group at TU Berlin mentored by Volker Markl and Jorge Quiané-Ruiz. 

My current research has been focusing on bringing confidential computing to large-scale data processing and building the foundations of privacy-preserving cloud systems.

Before joining TU Berlin as a researcher, I completed a double M.Sc. in ICT-Innovation at TU Berlin and UPM Madrid. During my Master thesis, I collaborated with Logical Clocks in Stockholm and developed infrastructure to enable streaming IoT data pipelines in Hopsworks.
